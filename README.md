# ESPHome components for Ecodan heatpumps
This is a set of components to read out and control Mitsubishi Ecodan heatpumps. I have an ERST20D-VM2D, it probably works for many air-water heatpumps with CN105 connector. It is highly inspired by https://github.com/BartGijsbers/CN105Gateway.

## Hardware
Info about the hardware can be found at https://github.com/SwiCago/HeatPump. I used the following:
- https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003547145418.html (take the PH2.0 to Dupont, 5P variant of the connector, it fits by cutting away some plastic)
- https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32582736130.html (take the ESP-01S, it has some more memory)
